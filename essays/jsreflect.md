<h1> Two Weeks Smelling the Javascript </h1>

<h2> Waking Up to Javascript </h2>
 
<img src="../images/codecademy_ss.png" style="float:right;">
Prior to these past two weeks, I had a generally negative impression of Javascript.  There was no specific reason.  That Javascript was an somewhat inferior language just seemed to be general opinion to some - particularly online.  As of writing, I honestly couldn't tell you whether or not Javascript is better than one language or another for a given task; but I'm definitely thinking many of those opinions were way off-base.  Javascript has a very streamlined feel about it, and its accessibility and functionality make it clear why it is has become the code of choice for many businesses. Thus far, I have only completed the basic Javascript courses at two online code schools: Codecademy and freeCodeCamp.  These introductory courses were relatively simple given I have already studied two semesters of Java; but I'm certain they'll prove useful for referencing syntax, as well as in continuing the development of my skills.  





	                                 
 
<h2> The Smoother Java </h2>

Two community college semesters of Java, capped by two weeks of Javascript, makes me an expert in neither.  Certainly, it will take several more years of study and practice - even after I have attained my degree - before I can hope to be so proficient.  However, there are clear and unavoidable distinctions between the two that even a novice programmer will notice immediately.  Personally, the first thing I noticed when beginning to work with Javascript was how intuitive it is when compared to Java.  For instance, where Java requires specific identification of variables by data-type, ie.: int, float, double, char, string, etc.; Javascript allows the developer to simply: let variable = x; such that, Javascript automatically detects and interprets the data-type.

```java
// Java example:

	int integer = 1;
	double number = 1.55;
	char letter = ‘a’;
	String string = “bcde”;
```
```javascript
// Javascript example:

	let integer = 1;
	let number = 1.55;
	let string = ‘a’;
	let string2 = ‘bcde’;
```

In JS, 'let' is used similarly to create arrays, and even objects.  This sort of improvement over Java gives JS-coding an overall feel and style that makes implementation feel much less tedious.  I’m positive as I become more familiar with JS and its features, I’ll become more aware of its own shortfalls.  However, as of this moment, I’m enjoying Javascript’s simplicity, relative to Java; and I look forward to becoming more familiar with the distinct strengths and weaknesses between Java and JS; and whatever other programming languages I learn going forward with my studies in computer science and software engineering. 

<h2> A Daily Grind </h2>

As with all things, practice makes perfect, and learning the ins and outs of Javascript will certainly require a lot it; and despite having daily coding challenges delivered to my email every morning - I'm admittedly very poor about keeping up with daily practice.  Fortunately, the ICS program at UH Manoa encourages students to utilize the 'athletic' method of learning software engineering.  The big idea behind athletic software engineering is precisely: daily practice.  I appreciate this philosophy because I do believe it is the best way to learn something, and also because - ideally - it will help me focus on time management.  That all said, I am not particularly fond of the idea of in-class 'Workouts of the Day.'  These work like quizzes and are timed; presumably, with the finishing time being a part of the grade for a little extra stress.  While I acknowledge that a programmer should be proficient enough to put a small program together in a short amount of time; some people perform better at certain times of day, or in different environments.  I myself have a hard time being comfortable in some classrooms, and that can make it difficult for me to really focus in them.  Considering that at home, I have two extra monitors, a comfy mesh chair, and enough space for a mouse - it shouldn't be too surprising that I might be more productive outside the classroom.  In-class WODs aside, I think the athletic learning format will be an effective one for me.
