<h1> Two Weeks of Smelling the Javascript </h1>

<h2> Waking to Javascript </h2>
 
<p> </p>
 
<h2> The Smoother Cup of Joe </h2>

<p> Two community college semesters of Java, capped by two weeks of Javascript makes me an expert in neither.  Certainly, it will take several more years of study and practice - even after I have attained my degree - before I can hope to be competitive.  However, there are clear and unavoidable distinctions between the two that even a novice programmer will notice immediately.  Personally, the first thing I noticed when beginning to work with Javascript was how intuitive it is when compared to Java.  For instance, where Java requires specific identification of variables by data-type, ie.: int, float, double, char, string, etc.; Javascript allows the developer to simply: let variable = x; such that Javascript automatically detects and interprets the data-type. </p>

```
// Java example:

	int integer = 1;
	double double = 1.55;
	char char = ‘a’;
	string string = “bcde”;


// Javascript example:

	let integer = 1;
	let number = 1.55;
	let string = ‘a’;
	let string2 = ‘bcde’;
```
<p>In JS, let is used similarly to create arrays and objects.  Another feature that I feel JS improved over Java is in declaring functions: </p>
```
// Java example:

public static void functionName() {
//this function performs the given operations, does not ‘return’ an output	
} 

public String functionName () {
	/* this function performs the given operations, but must 
    also return a String(or other data-type) as output 
*/
	
}	

// Javascript example:

	function functionName() {
		// ‘return’ may or may not be used
	}
```
<p>So far, JS has an overall feel and style that makes implementation feel much less tedious.  I’m positive as I become more familiar with JS and its features, I’ll become more aware of shortfalls when it compares to Java.  However, as of this moment, I’m enjoying Javascript’s simplicity, relative to Java; and I look forward to becoming more familiar with the distinct strengths and weaknesses between these, and whatever other programming languages I learn going forward with my studies in computer science and software engineering. </p>
