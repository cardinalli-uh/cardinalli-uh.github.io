<h2> Waking Up to Javascript </h2>
 
<img src="../images/codecademy_ss.png" style="float:right;">
Two weeks ago, I took my first steps on the path to learning Javascript(JS).  Not necessarily because I wanted to, but because I am a student, and the time to learn Javascript had come.  Prior to these past two weeks, I had a generally negative impression of Javascript.  There was no specific reason.  The idea that JS was a somewhat inferior language just seemed to be general opinion to many - particularly online.  To be clear, I was never against learning it; but I'm also not as proactive and I could be, and so had not gone very far out of my way to become exposed to it.  Thus far, I have only completed the basic Javascript courses at two online code schools: Codecademy and freeCodeCamp.  These introductory courses were relatively simple given I have already studied two semesters of the programming language, Java; but I felt they were practical, and I'm certain they'll prove useful for referencing syntax, as well as in continuing the development of my skills.  At my current experience level, I honestly couldn't tell you whether Javascript is better than one language or another for any given task; but as of writing this, I'm definitely thinking many of those negative opinions of JS were way off-base, or perhaps just out-dated.  Javascript has a very streamlined feel about it, and its accessibility and functionality make it clear why it is has become the code of choice for many businesses.   	                                 
 
<h2> The Smoother Java </h2>
 
As mentioned, other than Javascript, I have some experience with the programming language Java.  Certainly, two community college semesters of Java, capped by two weeks learning Javascript, makes me an expert in neither.  It will take several more years of study and practice - even after I have attained my degree - before I can hope to be so proficient; but at first glance, Java and Javascript are incredibly similar to one another.  However, there are clear and unavoidable distinctions between the two that any novice programmer will notice immediately.  Personally, the first thing I noticed when beginning to work with Javascript was how intuitive it is when compared to Java.  For instance, where Java requires specific identification of variables by data-type, ie.: int, float, double, char, string, etc.; Javascript allows the developer to simply: let variable = x; such that, Javascript automatically detects and interprets the data-type.

```java
// Java example:

	int integer = 1;
	double number = 1.55;
	char letter = ‘a’;
	String string = “bcde”;
```
```javascript
// Javascript example:

	let integer = 1;
	let number = 1.55;
	let string = ‘a’;
	let string2 = ‘bcde’;
```

In JS, 'let' is used similarly to create arrays, and even objects.  Additionally, while an array created in Java can only contain a single data-type, an array in Javascript can be mixed freely; such that, the same array could hold numbers, string, arrays, objects, etc.; these sorts of improvements over Java give JS-coding an overall style that makes implementation feel much less tedious.  I’m positive as I become more familiar with JS and its features, I’ll become more aware of its own shortfalls.  However, as of this moment, I’m enjoying Javascript’s simplicity, relative to Java; and I look forward to learning what other improvements JS has made over Java.

<h2> A Daily Grind </h2>

As with all things, practice makes perfect, and learning the ins and outs of Javascript will certainly require a lot it; and despite having daily coding challenges delivered to my email every morning - I'm admittedly very poor about keeping up with daily practice.  Fortunately, the ICS program at UH Manoa encourages students to utilize the 'athletic' method of learning software engineering.  The big idea behind athletic software engineering is precisely: daily practice.  I appreciate this philosophy because I do believe it is the best way to learn something, and also because - ideally - it will help me focus on time management.  That all said, I am not particularly fond of the idea of in-class 'Workouts of the Day.'  These work like quizzes and are timed; presumably, with the finishing time being a part of the grade for a little extra stress.  While I acknowledge that a programmer should be proficient enough to put a small program together in a short amount of time; some people perform better at certain times of day, or in different environments.  I myself have a hard time being comfortable in some classrooms, and that can make it difficult for me to really focus in them.  Considering that at home, I have the benefit of two large monitors, a comfy mesh chair, and enough space for a mouse - it shouldn't be too surprising that I might be more productive outside the classroom.  In-class WODs aside, I think the athletic learning format will be an effective one for me.
