<h1> Two Weeks Smelling the Javascript </h1>

<h2> Waking to Javascript </h2>
 
<p> </p>
 
<h2> The Smoother Cup of Joe </h2>

<p> Two community college semesters of Java, capped by two weeks of Javascript makes me an expert in neither.  Certainly, it will take several more years of study and practice - even after I have attained my degree - before I can hope to be competitive.  However, there are clear and unavoidable distinctions between the two that even a novice programmer will notice immediately.  Personally, the first thing I noticed when beginning to work with Javascript was how intuitive it is when compared to Java.  For instance, where Java requires specific identification of variables by data-type, ie.: int, float, double, char, string, etc.; Javascript allows the developer to simply: let variable = x; such that Javascript automatically detects and interprets the data-type. </p>

```
// Java example:

	int integer = 1;
	double double = 1.55;
	char char = ‘a’;
	string string = “bcde”;

// Javascript example:

	let integer = 1;
	let number = 1.55;
	let string = ‘a’;
	let string2 = ‘bcde’;
```

<p>In JS, let is used similarly to create arrays and objects.  This sort of improvement over Java gives JS-coding an overall feel and style that makes implementation feel much less tedious.  I’m positive as I become more familiar with JS and its features, I’ll become more aware of its own shortfalls.  However, as of this moment, I’m enjoying Javascript’s simplicity, relative to Java; and I look forward to becoming more familiar with the distinct strengths and weaknesses between Java and JS; and whatever other programming languages I learn going forward with my studies in computer science and software engineering. </p>
