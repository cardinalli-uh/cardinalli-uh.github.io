<h2>We Can Build It, We Have the Technology</h2>
<p>Like anything else that gets built, webpages are built using a combination of tools.  In web development, those tools are types of coding languages.  The cooler stuff we see on the web is typically handled by an actual programming language; typically Javascript, a high-level language which allows a web developer to implement functionality within their website; however - as important as functionality is - function is almost meaningless if not paired with an intuitive and attractive user interface.  For that we commonly combine the markup language, HTML, with the style language, CSS.  These are not functional programming languages in the mold of C, Python, Javascript, etcetera; instead, HTML and CSS are devoted to adjusting the look, feel, and clarity of a website.</p>

<h2>We Have the Capability to Build the World Wide Web</h2>

<p>Like a lot of tools, HTML and CSS are versatile and functional, but using them can be laborious.  Unfortunately, sometimes there really is only one tool for the job.  It may not make the work any less backbreaking; sometimes a tool just makes something possible, and so we use it.  Afterall, it isn’t about how easy a tool is to use, but what the tool can help us accomplish that makes it useful.  Even the simplest tools can accomplish great things, in the right hands.  And as they stand, HTML and CSS are simple; but they also provide just about everything we need to get any job done.  Still, they require a lot of ‘heavy-lifting’  and fair deal of expertise; and as such, have obvious room for improvement.  Which is why “frameworks” were created.  Frameworks are utility libraries that are built using HTML and CSS; however, unlike HTML and CSS - which were designed for functionality - frameworks are built to make that functionality more accessible.</p>

<h2>Better Than It Was Before - Better, Stronger, Faster</h2>
<p>The big idea behind a framework is to make web development more intuitive for the developer.  Frameworks improve on HTML and CSS by being easier to learn, faster to implement, and overall less frustrating to use than pure HTML and CSS.  This is all well and good, but the reality of the matter is - learning a framework can be just as involved as learning HTML or CSS.  And simply learning the framework as-is leaves the developer with an easy to implement, but totally generic website design.  Now certainly, in some cases, generic works; but in other cases, the better frameworks can be customized to suit the individual.  The bad news is, the scope of customization falls back on the developer’s skill with plain HTML and CSS.  That said, a framework is an undeniably powerful tool when considering ways to increase productivity; and properly customized, a framework can make it easier for a coder to implement a more unique look and feel in their web designs.  The real advantage of frameworks is right in their name; that is, they provide a frame by which to help make HTML and CSS work.  The point being, HTML and CSS are still in the mix.  Implementing a framework is all well and good, but as long as HTML and CSS are at the foundation, proficiency with them will be essential for any web developer.</p>
