<h2>We Can Rebuild It, We Have the Technology!</h2>
<p> Whether the goal were to rebuild astronaut, Steve Austin, into the Six Million Dollar Man, or just to rebuild a plain text site into a professional looking webpage, there are tools we would need to get the job done.  And just like it is with almost anything else that gets built, webpages are built using a combination of tools.  Fortunately we don't need anything too fancy or expensive to get building.  That is because, in web development, those tools are coding languages.  The cooler stuff we see on the web is typically handled by an actual programming language; typically Javascript, a high-level language which allows a web developer to implement functionality within their website.  As important as functionality is though - function is almost meaningless if it isn't paired with an intuitive and attractive user interface.  For that we commonly combine the markup language, HTML, with the style language, CSS.  These are not full programming languages in the mold of C, Python, Javascript, etcetera; instead, HTML and CSS are devoted to adjusting the look, feel, and clarity of a website.</p>

<h2>We Have the Capability to Build the World Wide Web!</h2>
<p> Like a lot of tools, HTML and CSS are versatile and functional, but using them can be laborious.  Unfortunately, sometimes there really is only one tool for the job.  It may not make the work any less backbreaking; sometimes a tool just makes something possible, and so we use it.  Sometimes it isn’t about how easy a tool is to use, or how easy one can make a task; but simply what the tool can help us accomplish that makes it useful.  And as they stand, HTML and CSS provide just about everything we need to get their part of the job done. Still, being effective with HTML or CSS requires a considerable amount of expertise and patience; as such, HTML and CSS developers were left wanting.  Hence, “UI frameworks” were created.  Frameworks are utility libraries that are built using HTML and CSS; however, unlike HTML and CSS - which were designed for functionality - frameworks are built to make HTML and CSS more accessible.</p>

<h2>Better Than It Was Before - Better, Stronger, Faster!</h2>
<p> The big idea behind a framework is to make web development more intuitive for the developer.  Frameworks improve on pure HTML and CSS by being easier to learn, faster to implement, and overall less frustrating to use.  This is all well and good, but the reality of the matter is that learning a framework can be just as involved as learning HTML or CSS.  And simply learning the framework as-is leaves the developer with an easy to implement, but totally generic website design.  Now certainly, in some cases, generic works; but in other cases, the better frameworks can be customized to suit the individual.  The bad news is, the scope of customization largely falls back to the developer’s skill with plain HTML and CSS.  That said, a framework is an undeniably powerful tool when considering ways to increase productivity; and properly customized, a framework can make it easier for a coder to implement a more unique look and feel in their web designs.  The real advantage of frameworks is right in their name; that is, they provide a frame by which to help make HTML and CSS work.  The point being, frameworks are an excellent utility; but as long as HTML and CSS are still mixed into the foundation, proficiency with them will be the difference between the commonplace and the exceptional.</p>
