<h2>UwHy?</h2>

<p>	UHire is a mock company my team and I created for our final project in ICS314, Software Engineering, at UH Manoa.  Over the course of a month, the five person team which I was a part of developed a business website for UHire.  The purpose of the website was to enable UH Manoa students who are seeking employment to match with professional recruiters who are seeking talent, and vise versa. The site was developed using the Meteor framework and Semantic UI React.  And it was deployed via the Galaxy hosting service. </p>

<h2>UwHo?</h2>
<p>	UHire was a team effort, aside from myself, the development team included: Keoni Fontanilla, Peter Newton, Kyle Okamoto, and John Yap.  One of the biggest components to this project was teamwork.  Fortunately, the UHire team was fairly dedicated to collaborating to meet deadlines; and through the utilization of 'Issues' and 'Milestones' on Github, relaying important deadlines was relatively simple.  Still, challenges arose in regards to schedule conflicts, from which stemmed the sorts of confusing moments that might have been avoided had all of us been able to meet.  Still, we made due using Slack, and occasionally Discord to communicate important topics. </p> 

<h2>UwHat?</h2>
<p>	For my part in the project, I was very involved in managing the collections and connecting them to the appropriate content, developing the bulk of the website's user interface, and implementing a search feature for the student and company directories.  Aside from that, I maintained our database on MongoDB Atlas and handled our deployment to Galaxy.  I also feel I fell into a project management role.  That isn't to say my team needed much management - we were all fairly self-sufficient and focused - still, there were times when general direction was needed.  </p>
<p>	In total, I would consider this a valuable and humbling experience.  There were many aspects that - going into the experience - I presumed would be triflingly easy, but ended up being immensely challenging; such as, the company location map component put together largely by Keoni, but with a big hand from Peter.  We were all under the impression that this feature would come together relatively quickly.  The reality was Keoni spending the majority of his time figuring out how to integrate the function; and once he did get it all figured out, he had already maxed out the credits made available by the free trial account we were using for development - which threatened our being able to offer a location mapping function.  The search bar was also much more complicated than initially expected.  These challenges, and plenty others, showed me how far a ways I still have to go until I can consider myself a capable developer.  However, we did get around these challenges, and we were relatively happy with the final outcome.  Ideally, I'll be able to reflect on this experience in the future to be a better team member and coder.
