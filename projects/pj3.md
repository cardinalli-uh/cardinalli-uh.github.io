summary: Volunteered at Diamond Head Crater.
---

    I began volunteering at Oahu’s Diamond Head in October of 2018 to meet a grade requirement for a college course.  The volunteer project required a 20 hour contribution; as of writing, I have volunteered just shy 40 total hours to conserving the crater.  As Oahu’s most visited tourist site, Diamond Head Crater receives an average of 3,000 daily visitors during the busy season.  The majority of these visitors do so respectfully; regardless, largely due to human activity, the crater’s unique ecosystem remains susceptible to degradation.  More often than not, humans are either unaware of, or indifferent to, their impact.  By volunteering at Diamond Head, I have been able to directly contribute to the well-being of the crater.  

    The majority of the work involved watering native plants, weeding out invasive plants, trail maintenance, and mulching.  The goal was to protect the endemic and indigenous plant species that are native to Hawaii; while minimizing the spread of harmful invasive species.  On occasion, we have also pruned trees, cleared caterpillar infestations, and planted seeds.
  
    Through volunteering I gained a greater appreciation for the efforts of park staff, and for other volunteers.  It is thanks to the dedicated park staff that Diamond Head is in such a good state despite how heavily trafficked it is.  My experience has also affected my view on the impact of tourism: one of the days I volunteered, four of us hiked the trail to pick-up litter - two staff and two volunteers; initially, I was unsurprised by the amount of garbage we found, considering the number of people hiking that day; however, by the time the four of us reached the top, we had filled all of our garbage bags - mostly with empty water bottles and trolley tickets; additionally, new trash had already accumulated by the time we set back down the trail.  The total experience - whether it be the management of plant life or of trail maintenance - impressed upon me how important it is that we work both within our communities, as well as on a state and national level, to preserve the natural world.
